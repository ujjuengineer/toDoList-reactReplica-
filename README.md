# 📝 React-like To-Do List (Vanilla JS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple **To-Do List** built using **pure JavaScript** to replicate some core concepts of **React**—like state management, component-based structure, and re-rendering. 🚀  

## 🔍 How It Works  
- **State Management**: The `todos` array stores tasks dynamically.  
- **Component-like Structure**: The `createTodoComponent()` function generates UI elements similar to React components.  
- **Manual Re-rendering**: The `render()` function updates the DOM by clearing and re-adding elements when changes occur.  

## 🛠️ Features  
✔️ Add new tasks dynamically  
✔️ Remove tasks with a "Delete" button  
✔️ Mimics React’s state-based updates
